## About The Project
<p>
Music is in every corner of the world, it is the one thing that connects us all. Now, given the rapid technological development, now-a-days, people are listening to songs on their mobile phones. There are roughly 140 million monthly music listeners (approx. data for Spotify) in the U.S alone. But every year 9% of the users are withdrawing their subscription because of the algorithm that suggests songs to the user.
  
We have created a chatbot to solve current music listenersâ€™ struggles. The chatbot is capable of interpreting the mood of the user and then recommending songs based on it.
